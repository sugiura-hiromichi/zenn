# Attentions

1. MetaData includes health plans

2. Set Calender of that week based on WEEKLYLOG.md
   - Plans should be manageable

3. WEEKLYLOGs are referencing MONTHLYLOG
   - Plans should be a little challenging one

4. Category classifying must explicitly written in *LOGs.md
   - Category is just a example. Don't be so serious!
   - Category priority is important to make actual progress. Make it visible.
